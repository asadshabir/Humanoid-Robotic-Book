## PROMPT_TEXT

$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Revisited the UI Enhancement & Author Profile Fix feature implementation. All tasks from the original implementation have been completed and verified. The tasks.md file was updated to mark all 30 tasks as completed ([X]) since the implementation was previously executed successfully.

The implementation includes:
- Enhanced landing page with professional animations
- Accurate author information display with circular profile image and glow animation
- Improved book reading experience with subtle animations
- Footer enhancements with social links and hover effects
- Accessibility features including reduced motion support
- Proper static asset paths (/img/... format)
- CSS-only animations for performance
- Successful build verification

All requirements from the original specification have been met and the site builds successfully with no errors.

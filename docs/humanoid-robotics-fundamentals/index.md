# Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals

Welcome to the fundamentals of humanoid robotics, where we explore the essential principles that enable robots to move and interact with human-like capabilities. This module covers the mechanical and control foundations that make humanoid robots distinctive from other robotic systems.

## Overview

Humanoid robotics combines the complexity of human-like form with advanced control systems to create robots capable of operating in human-designed environments. This module provides a comprehensive foundation in the anatomy, kinematics, and control principles that make humanoid robots possible, from basic mechanics to advanced stability and locomotion systems.

## Learning Path

This module is structured to build your understanding progressively:

1. **Anatomy of Humanoid Robots**: Understanding the physical structure and components
2. **Degrees of Freedom and Kinematics**: Exploring how motion is achieved and controlled
3. **Forward vs Inverse Kinematics**: Understanding mathematical approaches to motion control
4. **Dynamics and Stability**: Learning how forces and balance are managed
5. **Balance, Gait, and Locomotion**: Mastering the principles of bipedal movement

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robot fundamentals.

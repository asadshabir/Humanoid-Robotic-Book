# Perception Systems

Perception systems form the sensory foundation that enables humanoid robots to understand and interact with their environment. These systems integrate multiple sensing modalities including vision, LiDAR, inertial measurement, and proprioception to create comprehensive environmental models and self-awareness. This module provides a comprehensive understanding of how humanoid robots perceive their world, from basic sensor principles to advanced fusion techniques and mapping algorithms.

## Overview

Perception in humanoid robotics encompasses the complete pipeline from raw sensor data to actionable environmental understanding. This includes:

- **Visual Perception**: Processing camera images to recognize objects, understand scenes, and track motion
- **Sensory Integration**: Combining multiple sensor modalities for robust perception
- **State Estimation**: Determining the robot's position, orientation, and internal configuration
- **Environmental Mapping**: Creating and maintaining representations of the surrounding environment
- **Localization**: Determining the robot's location within known or unknown environments

The integration of these capabilities enables humanoid robots to operate autonomously in complex, dynamic environments while maintaining safe and effective interaction with humans and objects.

## Learning Path

This module is structured to build your understanding progressively:

1. **Vision Systems**: Understanding camera-based perception and computer vision techniques
2. **LiDAR, IMU, and Proprioception**: Exploring range sensing, inertial measurement, and self-awareness
3. **Sensor Fusion Techniques**: Learning to combine multiple sensor modalities effectively
4. **Environmental Mapping and Localization (SLAM)**: Mastering simultaneous mapping and localization

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of humanoid robot perception systems.

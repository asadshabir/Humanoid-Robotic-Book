# Services and Actions

## Overview

This chapter covers advanced communication patterns in ROS 2, specifically services and actions, which provide synchronous and goal-oriented communication respectively.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Implement service-based communication
- Create and use actions for goal-oriented tasks
- Choose appropriate communication patterns for different scenarios
- Understand Quality of Service (QoS) settings

## Services in ROS 2

Services provide a request-response communication pattern. A service client sends a request and waits for a response from the service server.

```python
# Example service server
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts

class MinimalService(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_service')
        self.srv = self.create_service(AddTwoInts, 'add_two_ints', self.add_two_ints_callback)

    def add_two_ints_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        self.get_logger().info('Incoming request\na: %d b: %d' % (request.a, request.b))
        return response
```

## Actions

Actions are used for long-running tasks that require:
- Goal request
- Continuous feedback
- Result reporting

## Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS settings allow fine-tuning of communication behavior, including reliability, durability, and history policies.

## When to Use Each Pattern

- **Topics**: For streaming data or event notifications
- **Services**: For simple request-response interactions
- **Actions**: For long-running tasks with feedback

## Implementation Examples

Practical examples demonstrating each communication pattern in real-world scenarios.

## Summary

This chapter completed our exploration of ROS 2 communication patterns. The next module will cover digital twins.

## Validation Hooks
- [ ] Verify service and action examples are accurate
- [ ] Confirm QoS explanations are clear and correct
- [ ] Ensure practical examples are relevant and helpful

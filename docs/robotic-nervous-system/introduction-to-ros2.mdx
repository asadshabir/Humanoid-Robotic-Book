# Introduction to ROS 2

## Overview

This chapter provides an introduction to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Identify key differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Set up a basic ROS 2 development environment
- Create your first ROS 2 package

## What is ROS 2?

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

> **Key Concept**: ROS 2 is not an operating system, but rather a middleware framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster.

## ROS 1 vs ROS 2

ROS 2 addresses several limitations of the original ROS:

- **Real-time support**: Improved real-time capabilities
- **Multi-robot systems**: Better support for multiple robots
- **Production deployment**: More suitable for production environments
- **DDS integration**: Uses Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication

## Installation and Setup

The installation process for ROS 2 varies by operating system. The recommended approach is to follow the official installation guide for your specific platform.

## Basic Concepts

ROS 2 introduces several core concepts:

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Goal-oriented communication with feedback

## Your First ROS 2 Package

Creating your first package involves using the `ros2 pkg create` command with the appropriate options.

## Summary

This chapter introduced the fundamental concepts of ROS 2. In the next chapter, we'll explore nodes and communication patterns in more detail.

## Validation Hooks
- [ ] Verify ROS 2 installation steps are accurate
- [ ] Confirm all basic concepts are explained clearly
- [ ] Ensure examples are up-to-date with latest ROS 2 versions

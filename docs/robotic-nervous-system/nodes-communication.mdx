# Nodes and Communication

## Overview

This chapter explores the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2: nodes and the communication mechanisms that allow them to interact.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes
- Implement topic-based communication
- Use services for request/response patterns
- Understand the publisher-subscriber model

## Understanding Nodes

A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system.

```python
# Example of a minimal ROS 2 node in Python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MinimalPublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1
```

## Publisher-Subscriber Pattern

The publisher-subscriber pattern is the primary communication method in ROS 2. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics.

## Services

Services provide a request-response communication pattern, which is synchronous and allows for direct interaction between nodes.

## Creating Nodes in Python and C++

Both Python and C++ are supported for creating ROS 2 nodes, with similar APIs for node creation and communication.

## Communication Best Practices

Effective communication in ROS 2 involves understanding message types, QoS policies, and system architecture.

## Summary

This chapter covered the core communication patterns in ROS 2. The next chapter will explore services and actions in greater detail.

## Validation Hooks
- [ ] Verify code examples are correct and functional
- [ ] Confirm QoS settings are explained properly
- [ ] Ensure all communication patterns are demonstrated

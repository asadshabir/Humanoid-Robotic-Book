## Co-simulation Concepts

Co-simulation involves running multiple simulation environments simultaneously and exchanging data between them in real-time.

## Gazebo-Unity Integration

Combining Gazebo's physics accuracy with Unity's visual capabilities creates powerful simulation environments.

## Communication Protocols

Establishing reliable communication between simulation environments requires careful consideration of timing and data formats.

## Use Cases and Examples

Real-world examples of co-simulation in robotics development and testing.

## Validation and Verification

Ensuring that co-simulation results are accurate and reliable requires specific validation approaches.

## Summary

This chapter completed our exploration of digital twin technologies. The next module will cover AI-Robot brains.

## Validation Hooks
- [ ] Verify co-simulation implementation steps are accurate
- [ ] Confirm communication protocol examples are valid
- [ ] Ensure validation techniques are appropriate

## Introduction to Gazebo

Gazebo is a physics-based simulation engine that provides realistic simulation of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. It includes:

- High-fidelity physics simulation
- Advanced 3D graphics
- Multiple sensors
- User interfaces

## Installation and Setup

Gazebo can be installed as a standalone application or integrated with ROS 2 for robotics development.

## Gazebo Architecture

Understanding the architecture of Gazebo is crucial for effective simulation:

- **Gazebo Server**: Runs the physics simulation
- **Gazebo Client**: Provides the user interface
- **Plugins**: Extend functionality

## Creating Simulation Worlds

Simulation worlds in Gazebo are defined using SDF (Simulation Description Format) files that specify the environment, objects, and physics properties.

## Robot Models and URDF

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files describe robot models and can be imported into Gazebo for simulation.

## Physics Simulation

Gazebo uses ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) for physics simulation, providing realistic interactions between objects.

## Summary

This chapter provided the fundamentals of Gazebo simulation. The next chapter will explore Unity integration.

## Validation Hooks
- [ ] Verify Gazebo installation instructions are accurate
- [ ] Confirm SDF and URDF explanations are clear
- [ ] Ensure physics simulation concepts are properly explained

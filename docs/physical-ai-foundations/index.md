# Physical AI Foundations

Welcome to the foundational module of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This section introduces the core concepts that differentiate Physical AI from traditional digital AI, establishing the theoretical groundwork for understanding embodied intelligence and sensorimotor integration.

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from conventional artificial intelligence systems that operate primarily in digital environments to intelligence that is intrinsically tied to physical embodiment and real-world interaction. This module explores the fundamental principles that make Physical AI systems capable of meaningful interaction with the physical world.

## Learning Path

This module is designed to provide a progressive understanding of Physical AI concepts:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI**: Understanding what makes Physical AI different from digital AI
2. **Embodied Intelligence**: Exploring how intelligence emerges from the interaction between body, environment, and control systems
3. **Sensory Integration**: Learning how sensors enable Physical AI systems to perceive their environment
4. **Actuation and Motion**: Understanding how actuators enable Physical AI systems to act in the physical world
5. **Control Systems**: Discovering how feedback loops enable adaptive, robust behavior

Each section builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive foundation for advanced topics in humanoid robotics.
